*This component is fully functional, but there might be soon some breaking changes to the API.*

This component renders google map with markers. Custom styles available. Almost all google map options supported through props.

**Warning**

This component **does not** add the google API script tag to your application, so make sure you add it in the head of your app. The API source is here: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR-API-KEY
